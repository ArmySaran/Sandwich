ingredients (inventory items)
menu_items (products for sale)
recipes (item compositions)
sales (transactions)
sale_items (transaction details)
expenses (business costs)
daily_operations (daily summaries)
```

### Business Logic Triggers
```sql
-- Automatic inventory deduction after sales
CREATE TRIGGER update_inventory_after_sale
    AFTER INSERT ON sale_items
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_inventory_quantities();

-- Real-time low stock notifications
CREATE TRIGGER check_low_stock_trigger
    AFTER UPDATE OF quantity ON ingredients
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION create_low_stock_notification();
```

### Analytics Views
```sql
-- Real-time sales analytics
CREATE VIEW sales_analytics AS
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
    SUM(total) as total_revenue,
    AVG(total) as average_order_value
FROM sales GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at);

-- Menu profitability analysis
CREATE VIEW menu_profitability AS
SELECT
    m.name,
    m.price,
    m.cost,
    (m.price - m.cost) as profit,
    ROUND(((m.price - m.cost) / m.price) * 100, 2) as profit_margin
FROM menu_items m;
```
